//Variables
var name = "justin"; //old school javascript (99% of the time dont use this)
const fruit = "banana"; //constant binding (lock it in the cup) 
let veggie = "carrot"; //similar to var, but some other differences...
console.log("name: ", name); //print
console.log("fruit: ", fruit);
console.log("veggie: ", veggie);

//Simple Data Types
//Strings
const aString = "things and stuff";
//a string => spaces in variable names are.... BAD AS F!!!!!
//so we remove the space and capitalize all words but the first
// this is called camel casing CONVENTION!!!
const anotherString = 'some other things and stuff'; //this is single quotes
const stringWithNumbers = '1234.56.05055';
console.log('aString: ', aString);
console.log('anotherString: ', anotherString);
console.log('stringWithNumbers: ', stringWithNumbers);
console.log('what is the type of aString? ', typeof aString);
// Strings will come back up. There is more to know...
// Numbers
const aNumber = 1;
const anotherNumber = 3.5;
console.log('aNumber: ', aNumber);
console.log('anotherNumber: ', anotherNumber);
